# This is the bootcamp project
## git and github tutorial
all the steps here require you to sue the terminal in pycharm
- everytime before you want to work on the project:
    - type command:
```bash
  git pull
  ```
  the above command makes sure your code is up-to-date with the shared version
<br />
<br />
- Then, when you are done coding, you need to:
    - type three commands:
```bash
  git add <the name of the file you modified>  
  ```
  above command makes sure the specific file is tracked
<br />
<br />
```bash
  git commit -m <a message to your teammates>  
  ```
  above code is a "confirmation" of the changes you made
<br />
<br />  
```bash
  git push  
  ```
  and the above code is the last step. The shared code is updated.
